# Grouping-and-precoding
 We propose a density-based clustering two-stage precoding scheme to solve the problems of non-channel reciprocity and high complexity of precoding of downlink channels in a FDD Massive MIMO system. After dividing the users with equivalent of channel autocorrelation matrix into one group, we perform two-stage precoding for each group to reduce system overhead.
